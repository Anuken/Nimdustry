# Nimdustry

A Nim version of Mindustry. Not intended to be a complete game. Partially made as a learning experience.

## Objectives

- Experiment with ECS design, multithreading and various optimization techniques
- Try to have a cleaner codebase than Mindustry (which isn't saying much)
- Reimplement many mechanics, simplify others
- Create a more deterministic transportation system
- Experiment with RTS mechanics, like direct unit control and true fog of war
- Learn more about Nim and lower-level programming
- Return to pixel art, simplify the drawing process
